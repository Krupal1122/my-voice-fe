## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Business Data
Create a central configuration file with your business information:

```tsx
// config/businessData.ts
export const businessData = {
  businessName: "Your Business Name",
  address: {
    streetAddress: "123 Main Street",
    addressLocality: "Your City",
    addressRegion: "Your State", 
    postalCode: "12345",
    addressCountry: "US"
  },
  phone: "+1-555-123-4567",
  email: "contact@yourbusiness.com",
  website: "https://yourbusiness.com",
  businessType: "LocalBusiness",
  openingHours: [
    "Monday 09:00 17:00",
    "Tuesday 09:00 17:00",
    "Wednesday 09:00 17:00",
    "Thursday 09:00 17:00", 
    "Friday 09:00 17:00",
    "Saturday 10:00 16:00",
    "Sunday Closed"
  ],
  geoCoordinates: {
    latitude: 40.7128,
    longitude: -74.0060
  },
  socialProfiles: [
    "https://facebook.com/yourbusiness",
    "https://linkedin.com/company/yourbusiness"
  ]
};
```

### Step 2: Add to Your Pages
Import and use the components in your pages:

```tsx
import { LocalBusinessSchema } from '../components/SEO/LocalBusinessSchema';
import { LocalSEOHead } from '../components/SEO/LocalSEOHead';
import { NAP } from '../components/SEO/NAP';
import { businessData } from '../config/businessData';

export function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <LocalSEOHead
        title="Professional Services"
        description="Quality services for your needs"
        businessName={businessData.businessName}
        location={`${businessData.address.addressLocality}, ${businessData.address.addressRegion}`}
        keywords={["service", "professional", "quality"]}
        canonicalUrl={businessData.website}
      />
      
      <LocalBusinessSchema {...businessData} />
      
      <div>
        {/* Your page content */}
        <NAP {...businessData} variant="compact" />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Ensure NAP Consistency
Use the validation utility to check consistency:

```tsx
import { validateNAPConsistency } from '../utils/localSEOHelpers';

// Check NAP consistency across your site
const napInstances = [
  headerNAP,
  footerNAP,
  contactPageNAP
];

const validation = validateNAPConsistency(napInstances);
if (!validation.isConsistent) {
  console.warn('NAP inconsistencies found:', validation.issues);
}
```
